War Game is meant to be a text board game, like the physical one I made in middle school.
Players will start in landing craft, swim to the beach, move through obstacles while heading to the pill boxes.
Game ends when the player reaches the coastal town. They win, but war is war.

Gameplay should be simple, but rng is unforgiving.
Progress will be indicated by points (100 points = win | 0 = lose) 25 points to get to the next stage.
"Cards" will be random events where points will be given/ lost.
Each card can give or take 5 points, 25 points will be required to get to the next stage.
Later on, there might be a gui or turtles to illistate progress and cards.

Each stage will have to be defined, but cards within thse stages will be randomised.  So that players don't go back to a landing craft after clearing a pill box.
5 cards per stage?  First card on landing craft will be positive (Gate comes down).
Some of the cards will give choices to the player. Results of those choices should be random.
One choice might be: There's a jeep 20' away. Results: Jeep starts up, great progress; Jeep does not work, Germans take you out; great loss.

Programming:
Functions should be used.
